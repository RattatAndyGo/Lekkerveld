## website
This repository hosts all code related to my website, (insert url).

# Goal
I made this website for a number of reasons:
- I wanted some software project to spend my free time on
- I wanted to have a place where I can group random things I make
- I wanted to make certain projects and an easy way to share them, as some could be useful or fun

# Contact
You can contact me on Discord if you have any questions, suggestions or bug reports. My username is Andy_Go#1068.

# Using code
You are free to use parts of my code in any of your projects, if I am given credit (name & link to this repo are enough). Using entire files or sections of my website is allowed if it is credited and modified in some way. Don't just carbon copy an entire page, but make your own additions, give it your own twist. It would be nice if this addition was open source, but this isn't mandatory. Similarly, letting me know if you take a significant part of my code is nice, but not required.

# Changing code
Feel free to make a pull request if you want to change or update some things. If the change you want to make is significant, it might be worth the time to contact me first and to suggest the addition, in case I don't like the idea and won't use it.

# TODO
This todo list is specifically meant for me, but it also gives you a sneak peak at future additions.
