            <p>Use this bingo card generator to generate custom bingo cards for shiny hunting (or other challenges) in Pokemon.<br>
                Each slot has 4 options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Which Pokemon (or free slot) should be used?</li>
                    <li>From which game should the sprite come from?</li>
                    <li>Is the Pokemon shiny or not?</li>
                    <li>Is the Pokemon completed or not?</li>
                </ul>
                If the game has no sprite for the chosen Pokemon, the Pokemon is rerolled. This is to ensure that if a random Pokemon is incompatible with a chosen game, the game stays the same. If a random game clashes with a chosen Pokemon, the Pokemon will be rerolled, so watch out when picking a random game.<br>
                The randomizer checks for duplicate Pokemon, but other forms are seen as other Pokemon. Shiny/non-shiny is considered the same Pokemon. Additionally, the randomizer will not choose different forms.<br>

            <p>Planned future features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowing uploading custom images</li>
                    <li>Allowing multiple images per square (e.g. more than one pokemon, or an icon indicating a particular method like eggs)</li>
                    <li>Custom bingo dimensions</li>
                    <li>Sharing bingo card with other users (which also serves as a library of pregenerated cards)</li>
                    <li>Saving generated Bingo cards in local storage, to allow quick changes (like a "completed" stamp)</li>
                </ul>
                If you want a particular feature, let me know so I can make it a priority. You can also implement it yourself and make a pull request on Github.
